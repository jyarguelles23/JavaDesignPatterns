Adapter

1- We have an existing object which provides the functionality that client needs. But client code cant use
   this object beacause it expects an object with different interface.
2- Using adapter design pattern we make this existing object work with client by adapting the object to clients
   expected interface.
3- This patter is also called as wrapper asi wraps existing object.

Implement
1- Create a class for Adapter
    1.1-Adapter must implement the interface expected by client.
    1.2-First we are going to try out a class adapter by also extending from our existing class.
    1.3-In the class adapter implementation we are simply going to forward the method to another method inherited from adaptee.
    1.4- Next for object adapter we are only going to implement target interface and accept adaptee as constructor
         argument in adapter, make use of composition.
2-An object adapter should take adaptee as an argument in constructor or as a less preferred solution, you can instantiate it
  in the constructor thus tightly coupling with a specific adaptee.
