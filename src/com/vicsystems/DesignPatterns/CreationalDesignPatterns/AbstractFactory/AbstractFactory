Abstract Factory
1- Is used when we have two or more objects wich work together forming a kit or set and there can be multiple sets
   or kits than can be created by client code.
2- So we separate client code from concrete objects forming such a Set and also from the code which creates these sets.

Implementation Steps
1- We start by studying the product sets
 1.1- Create abstract factory as an abstract class or an interface.
 1.2- Abstract factory defines abstract methods for creating products.
 1.3- Provide concrete implementation of factory for each set of products.

2- Abstract factory makes use of factory method pattern. You can think of abstract factory as an object with
   multiple factory methods
