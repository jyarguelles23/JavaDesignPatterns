Object Pool
1- In our system if cost of creating an instance of a class is high and we need a large number of
   objects of this class for short duration, then we can use an object pool.
2- Here we either pre-create objects of the class or collect unused instances in an in memory cache.
   When code needs an object of this class we provide it from this cache.

3- One of the most complicated patterns to implement efficiently (without defects).
